This is the first post on this blog that will detail my [GSoC][gsoc] experience. I found out a few days ago that my [project][project] has been accepted and with the announcement of the accepted projects, the Community Bonding Period has officially begun.

I have already familiarized myself with the public communication channels of the [Boost][boost] community in general and of [Boost.Geometry][boostgeometry] in particular during the student application period and will work on the details for the milestones of my project during the next couple of days.
