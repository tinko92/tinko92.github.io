As per the [GSoC timeline][gsoc-timeline], the coding officially begins today. After some discussion on the milestones and the interfaces with my mentors during the community bonding period, I will work on the implementations first so that the insights gained through the implementation work can be incorporated into the final interfaces.

More specifically, this means I will start working on an initial implementation of random point sampling and [Delaunay triangulation][delaunay-triangulation]. I expect that some initial results can be presented at the end of the week.
